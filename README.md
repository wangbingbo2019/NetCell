The Supplementary Table contains supplementary table S1 and S2.  
## Description
**Supplementary Table S1** details the number of candidate genes per trait, with an average of 181 genes per trait.  
 **Supplementary Table S2.** The Tabula Sapiens project employed two single-cellRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, droplet microfluidics and flow cytometry sorting, to generate a comprehensive, high-resolution transcriptomic atlas of 483,152 cells across 24 human tissues and organs from 15 individuals. Using the OnClass tool, the researchers performed a unified annotation of cell types, successfully identifying 474 distinct cell populations.
